Final Year Project of my studies in UCD. Project analyses the performance of the Posenet Human Pose Estimation model on tennis players.

Data folder contains all of the PCJ scores for the various players. These are stored as csv files. Images folder contains images of all of the bar charts used to visualise the PCJ scores. The file key_poses.csv contains the frames of each key pose in each video. The data_analysis notebook can be ran sequentially to view the results.

In order to collect the PCJ scores, this repository was used to run the Posenet pose estimation model: https://github.com/rwightman/posenet-python
